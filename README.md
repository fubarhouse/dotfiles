# FubarHouse's dotfiles

My configuration for my MacBook accounts, which is expected to evolve over time.

This is originally a fork of [Jeff Geerling](https://twitter.com/geerlingguy)'s [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles), and is used within my fork of his [Mac Dev Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook) found [here](https://github.com/fubarhouse/mac-dev-playbook).
